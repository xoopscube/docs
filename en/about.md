## <span class="iconify" data-icon="flat-color-icons:about"></span> The Project

**The XOOPS Cube Project** is Open Source, friendly maintained, developed and supported by a volunteer group to expand the vision of a free internet integrating everyone's creativity and skills. A shared vision and the OSS guiding principles made the original project's strategy that is at the very beginning of the innovation process. Since 2005, XCube modularity in design and the freedom of choice allows developers and designers to use their favorite frameworks and libraries for their intended uses by end users. The fundamental building blocks of the project are the innovative concept **3S** that stands for : Simple, Secure, Scalable.

**XOOPS** is an acronym of "eXtensible Object Oriented Portal System". Though started as a portal system, it later developed into a web application framework. It aims to serve as a web framework for use by small, medium and large sites, through the installation of modules. 

On the New Year’s Day of 2002, XOOPS RC1 was released to the public. The original XOOPS code was based on PHP-Nuke 4.4.1 and myPHPNuke 1.8.5, although some 70-80 percent of the code was rewritten, as Onokazu wrote on the release announcement. By the end of May 2002, the team had released three point versions, and XOOPS moved to a server in Japan. 

**XOOPS Cube** forked from the original XOOPS to develop a new core and follow a different path development with the modular architecture. The fork was announced by Onokazu in May 2005 and started by the former Xoops Japan Team, who felt that security and multi-byte character support were not adequately addressed by the former Xoops management team.

 **The Xoops Cube Team** maintained Xoops 2.0.x JP series, a temporary branch for Japanese community, while developing Xoops Cube — the new application core implementing concepts of object-oriented programming, design patterns and real-time 3D rendering. **The XCube core** was developed from scratch by Kazuhisa Minato (lead programmer in the game industry). And the **Base Legacy System** was developed to ensure backwards compatibility with a set of modules for interoperability with XOOPS the older legacy system.

Xoops Cube Legacy 2.1.0 final was released on April 30, 2007. Meanwhile, Gigamaster (aka Nuno Luciano) joined the project team improving the user interface design, user experience and usability. Gijoe developed the very distinct and unique feature of duplicable modules (D3) and the community contributed in many ways to improve the core and release several D3 modules. The Package Legacy was released on july 28, 2012.

Since then The XOOPS Cube Project is led by highly skilled developers Kilica (XCCK, Content Creation Kit) and Nao-pon (Xelfinder, file manager) ensuring that development follows the values and principles of Open Source.

**XCL is the bundle package** coming out in 2019. **XCL** refers to the excellent design of the modular architecture composed of separate components that can be connected together. The XCL 2.3.0 release integrates Xelfinder, a filemanager with cloud support, a wysiwyg content editor with granular permissions and X-Updater to install and manage modules, themes and extensions. So site owners benefit from PHP7 performance and high level of security, a new intuitive GUI and user-friendly CMS while maintaining full control over their own data.

Moreover, the latest XCL development avoids constraining new designs with legacy backwards compatibility issues. The design process is simplified to take advantage from the extendable modular design of **XCube Core**. Thus improving the management of internationalization and localization, customization and personalization for flexible and extensible production with a free choice of frameworks and libraries.

## <span class="iconify" data-icon="flat-color-icons:reading"></span> The X-Codex 

The documentation is built on top of Docsify using a Markdown processor (also commonly referred to as a “parser”) to take the Markdown-formatted text and output it to HTML format. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. The X-Codex documentation can be easily edited locally or on Github and it is composed of the following parts: 

+ Overview and set up of your XCL application
+ Development environment with open source software
+ Guidelines to start a project and set yourself up for success
+ Continuous delivery to synchronize deployements and update projects in a sustainable way.
+ Tutorials to get started quickly with Customization, Personalization and Contribution.
