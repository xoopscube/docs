# <span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi:cube-outline"></span> Welcome

**XOOPS Cube** is a simple, secure and scalable web application platform. The modular architecture is built on top of the simple Cube core with PHP, SQL and a smarty powered theming system. This empowers everyone to create dynamic and content rich apps with ease - from the best looking blogs, portfolios, community forums, intranet and business websites to the much safer desktop applications on Linux, Mac or Windows.

# <span class="iconify" data-icon="logos:opensource"></span> The Project

**The XOOPS Cube Project** is free and Open Source, friendly maintained, developed and supported by a volunteer group to expand the vision of a free internet integrating everyone's creativity and skills. 

The XOOPS CUBE Project forked from the original XOOPS to follow a different path with the modular architecture. The fork was announced by Onokazu in May 2005 and started by the former Xoops Japan team, who felt that security and multi-byte character support were not adequately addressed by the former Xoops management team.

 The Xoops Cube team maintained Xoops 2.0.x JP series, a temporary branch for Japanese users, while developing Xoops Cube (the new application core developed from scratch by Kazuhisa Minato, lead programmer in the game industry) and Legacy (a set of modules to ensure backward compatibility).

Xoops Cube Legacy 2.1.0 final was released on April 30, 2007. Since then the project follows the values and principles of Open Source. So website owners benefit from high level of security while maintaining full control over their own data.

#  <span class="iconify" data-icon="flat-color-icons:about"></span> The App

**XCL** refers to the excellent design of the modular architecture composed of separate components that can be connected together. The latest **XCL** development avoids constraining new designs with legacy backwards compatibility issues and the design process is simplified to take advantage from the extendable modular design of **Cube Core** — it combines the advantages of standardization with those of customization through an intuitive graphical user interface to manage functionality and localization for flexible and extensible production.

# <span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi:book-open-page-variant"></span> The Docs 

**X-Codex** documentation is built on top of Docsify using a Markdown processor (also commonly referred to as a “parser”) to take the Markdown-formatted text and output it to HTML format. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. The **X-Codex** documentation can be easily edited locally or on Github and it is composed of the following parts: 

+ Overview and set up of your XCL application
+ Development environment with open source software
+ Guidelines to start a project and set yourself up for success
+ Tutorial to get started quickly with Markdown documentation
