# <span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi:cube-outline"></span> Welcome

**The XOOPS Cube Project** is a simple, secure and scalable web application platform. The modular architecture is built in PHP with the simple Cube core, SQL and a smarty theming system. This empowers everyone to create dynamic and content rich apps with HTML, CSS and Javascript - from the best looking blogs, forums, portfolios, intranet and business websites to the much safer desktop applications on Linux, Mac or Windows.

# <span class="iconify" data-icon="flat-color-icons:about"></span> The Project

**The XOOPS Cube Project** is free and Open Source, friendly maintained, developed and supported by a volunteer group to expand the vision of a free internet integrating everyone's creativity and skills. 

**XOOPS Cube** forked from the original XOOPS to follow a different path development of the modular architecture. The fork was announced by Onokazu in May 2005 and started by the former Xoops Japan team, who felt that security and multi-byte character support were not adequately addressed by the former Xoops management team.

 **The Xoops Cube team** maintained Xoops 2.0.x JP series, a temporary branch for Japanese community, while developing Xoops Cube — the new application core implementing concepts of object-oriented programming and real-time 3D rendering. The **Cube** core was developed from scratch by Kazuhisa Minato (lead programmer in the game industry). And a new **Base System** was developed to ensure backwards compatibility with a set of modules for interoperability with the older legacy system.

Xoops Cube Legacy 2.1.0 final was released on April 30, 2007. Meanwhile, Gigamaster (aka Nuno Luciano) joined the project team and improved the user interface design, user experience and usability. The Package Legacy was released on july 28, 2012. Since then XOOPS Cube Project is led by Kilica and Nao-pon ensuring that development follows the values and principles of Open Source. 
A new package XCL is coming out in 2019, so website owners benefit from high level of security and easy content management while maintaining full control over their own data.

# <span class="iconify" data-icon="flat-color-icons:multiple-devices"></span> The App 

**XCL** refers to the excellent design of the modular architecture composed of separate components that can be connected together. The latest **XCL** development avoids constraining new designs with legacy backwards compatibility issues. The design process is simplified to take advantage from the extendable modular design of **Cube Core** — to manage internationalization and localization, customization and personalization for flexible and extensible production with an intuitive graphical user interface.

# <span class="iconify" data-icon="flat-color-icons:reading"></span> The Docs 

**X-Codex** documentation is built on top of Docsify using a Markdown processor (also commonly referred to as a “parser”) to take the Markdown-formatted text and output it to HTML format. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. The **X-Codex** documentation can be easily edited locally or on Github and it is composed of the following parts: 

+ Overview and set up of your XCL application
+ Development environment with open source software
+ Guidelines to start a project and set yourself up for success
+ Tutorial to get started quickly with Markdown documentation
