# <span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi:cube-outline"></span> Welcome

**The XOOPS Cube Project** is a Simple, Secure and Scalable web application platform. The modular architecture is built in PHP with the Cube core, SQL and a smarty theming system. The graphical user interface empowers everyone to create dynamic and content rich apps with HTML, CSS and Javascript - from the best looking blogs, forums, portfolios, intranet and business websites to desktop applications on Linux, Mac or Windows.

# <span class="iconify" data-icon="flat-color-icons:about"></span> The Project

**The XOOPS Cube Project** is Open Source, friendly maintained, developed and supported by a volunteer group to expand the vision of a free internet integrating everyone's creativity and skills. A shared vision and the OSS guiding principles made the original project's strategy that is at the very beginning of the innovation process. The modularity in design and the freedom of choice allows developers and designers to use their favorite frameworks and libraries for their intended uses by end users. The project innovative concept 3S, that make up the fundamental building blocks of XCL, stands for : Simple, Secure, Scalable.

**The XOOPS** is an acronym of "eXtensible Object Oriented Portal System". Though started as a portal system, it later developed into a web application framework. It aims to serve as a web framework for use by small, medium and large sites, through the installation of modules. 

On the New Year’s Day of 2002, XOOPS RC1 was released to the public. The original XOOPS was based on PHP-Nuke 4.4.1 and myPHPNuke 1.8.5, although some 70-80 percent of the code was rewritten, as onokazu wrote on the release announcement. By the end of May 2002, the team had released three point versions, and XOOPS moved to a server in Japan. 

**The XOOPS Cube** forked from the original XOOPS to follow a different path development of the modular architecture. The fork was announced by Onokazu in May 2005 and started by the former Xoops Japan team, who felt that security and multi-byte character support were not adequately addressed by the former Xoops management team.

 **The Xoops Cube Team** maintained Xoops 2.0.x JP series, a temporary branch for Japanese community, while developing Xoops Cube — the new application core implementing concepts of object-oriented programming, design patterns and real-time 3D rendering. **The Cube** core was developed from scratch by Kazuhisa Minato (lead programmer in the game industry). **The Base Legacy System** was developed to ensure backwards compatibility with a set of modules for interoperability with XOOPS the older legacy system.

Xoops Cube Legacy 2.1.0 final was released on April 30, 2007. Meanwhile, Gigamaster (aka Nuno Luciano) joined the project team and improved the user interface design, user experience and usability. The Package Legacy was released on july 28, 2012. Since then XOOPS Cube Project is led by Kilica and Nao-pon ensuring that development follows the values and principles of Open Source. 

**The new package XCL** is coming out in 2019, so website owners benefit from PHP7 performance, high level of security, new User Interface and easy content management while maintaining full control over their own data.

# <span class="iconify" data-icon="flat-color-icons:multiple-devices"></span> The XCL App 

**XCL** refers to the excellent design of the modular architecture composed of separate components that can be connected together. The latest XCL development avoids constraining new designs with legacy backwards compatibility issues. The design process is simplified to take advantage from the extendable modular design of **Cube Core** — to manage internationalization and localization, customization and personalization for flexible and extensible production with an intuitive graphical user interface.

# <span class="iconify" data-icon="flat-color-icons:reading"></span> The X-Codex 

The documentation is built on top of Docsify using a Markdown processor (also commonly referred to as a “parser”) to take the Markdown-formatted text and output it to HTML format. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. The X-Codex documentation can be easily edited locally or on Github and it is composed of the following parts: 

+ Overview and set up of your XCL application
+ Development environment with open source software
+ Guidelines to start a project and set yourself up for success
+ Continuous delivery to synchronize deployements and update projects in a sustainable way.
+ Tutorials to get started quickly with Customization, Personalization and Contribution.
