**XOOPSCube** is a simple, secure and scalable web application platform. The modular architecture is built with PHP, SQL and a smarty powered theming system. This empowers everyone to create dynamic and content rich apps with ease - from the best looking blogs, portfolios, community forums, intranet and business websites to the much safer desktop applications on Linux, Mac or Windows.

# <span class="iconify" data-icon="logos:opensource"></span> The Project

**The XOOPSCube Project** is free and Open Source, friendly maintained, developed and supported by a volunteer group to expand the vision of a free internet integrating everyone's creativity and skills. 

The development is careful to trendy cross site script attack, so website owners benefit from high level of security while maintaining full control over their own data.

#  <span class="iconify" data-icon="flat-color-icons:about"></span> The App

**XCL** refers to the excellent design of the modular architecture composed of separate components that can be connected together. The latest **XCL** development avoids constraining new designs with legacy backwards compatibility issues and the design process is simplified to take advantage from the extendable modular design of **Cube Core** — it combines the advantages of standardization with those of customization through an intuitive graphical user interface to manage functionality and localization for flexible and extensible production.

# <span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi:book-open-page-variant"></span> The Docs 

**X-Codex** documentation is built on top of Docsify using a Markdown processor (also commonly referred to as a “parser”) to take the Markdown-formatted text and output it to HTML format. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. The **X-Codex** documentation can be easily edited locally or on Github and it is composed of the following parts: 

+ Overview and set up of your XCL application
+ Development environment with open source software
+ Guidelines to start a project and set yourself up for success
+ Tutorial to get started quickly with Markdown documentation
